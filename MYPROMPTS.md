## Add multiple images to an entry

I want to implement allowing the user to upload multiple images for an entry.  
I do not want you to produce any changes yet, just a plan.  
Check out @docs/PRD.md to know about routing and architecture details.  
The desired functionality is to allow the user to upload up to 3 images (currently only one)  
The user MUST upload at least 1 image.  
The first image (in images) in the entryTable can also be refered to as the "catalogue-image"  
The new feature must also allow replacing images and removing an image - but they cannot remove the single remaining image.  
Write a plan in @docs/plans/multipleImages.md, and let me validate it before starting the implementation.
